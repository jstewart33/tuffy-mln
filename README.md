tuffy-mln
=========

MLN program for ER created for Tuffy based on Alchemy ER example

Some important files to look at in this repository:

- prog_cs.mln: the MLN program
- query_cs.mln: the query file
- coraSepFixedhwng.[1-5].db: the evidence files

I have not had any success running Tuffy with this MLN, either for learning weights or making inferences. I need to contact the Tuffy team for assistance in making the appropriate changes to the MLN code to get it to work.

The Tuffy user manual can be found at

The Alchemy MLN program on which I have based my Tuffy code can be found at

   http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu/mlns/er/
   
One of the issues that I had for the project is that Tuffy claimed to have taken the Alchemy MLN programs "with minimal changes" and ran the programs significantly faster than Alchemy. This did not happen for my with Tuffy.

tuffy-mln
=========

MLN program for ER created for Tuffy based on Alchemy ER example

Some important files to look at in this repository:

- prog_cs.mln: the MLN program
- query_cs.mln: the query file
- coraSepFixedhwng.[1-5].db: the evidence files

I have not had any success running Tuffy with this MLN, either for learning weights or making inferences. I need to contact the Tuffy team for assistance in making the appropriate changes to the MLN code to get it to work.
